1. What is the purpose of a cryptographic nonce? What are some characteristics of a good nonce?

    a. The purpose of a cryptographic nonce is to enhance security and prevent certain types of attacks.
    b. Some characteristics of a good nonce include
        Unpredicatability
        Uniqueness
        Length
        Secrecy Not Required

2. What is the purpose of a hash? Why is this type of algorithm used in creating a MAC?

    a.  The primary purpose of a hash function is to transform data into a fixed-size representation, 
        commonly a digest, in a way that is fast and efficient.
    b.  A MAC is generated by applying a secret key to both the message and a hash function. 
        The hash function provides the integrity-checking aspect of the MAC. Even if an attacker 
        knows the hash function and intercepts the MAC, they cannot alter the message without 
        knowledge of the secret key.

3. One essential part of TLS is verifying certificates. Which part of network security (confidentiality, authentication, message integrity, and availability) do certificates address? Support your answer. 

    a.  Certificates primarily address the aspect of authentication in network security.
    b.  Certificates authenticate the identity of the server to the client. 
        They contain public keys associated with the entity's private key.
        By verifying the digital signature on the certificate using the CA's public key, 
        the recipient can be assured of the certificate's authenticity. 

4. TLS is used alongside many other application layer protocols besides HTTP. List two other protocols that TLS is used with and why that level of encryption is necessary.

    a.  SMTP and IMAP also have TLS in place.
    b.  Both examples require confidentiality, authentication, and integrity.
        With TLS in place, having multiple checks before data is sent, 
        helps achieve the desired level of security.
